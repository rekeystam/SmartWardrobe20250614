Image Analysis & Tagging





API Integration: Leverage Gemini Flash 2.0 API for advanced image analysis.



Attributes Detected:





Item type (e.g., shirt, pants, dress, shoes, jacket).



Demographic (age group, gender).



Color, material, pattern (e.g., striped, solid, checkered).



Occasion (casual, formal, sports, etc.).



File Handling:





Auto-rename files: <color>_<occasion>_<item>.jpg (e.g., blue_casual_shirt.jpg, black_formal_shoes.jpg).



Resize images for optimal display and storage (max 2MB, 1080p resolution).



Reject duplicates using perceptual image hash (pHash) comparison.



Reject unsupported formats (e.g., non-JPEG/PNG) or oversized images (>10MB).



Provide clear error messages:





"Unsupported file format. Please upload JPEG or PNG."



"Image too large. Max size: 10MB."



"Duplicate image detected. Please upload a unique item."



Item Sorting:





Automatically categorize items post-upload into predefined wardrobe sections:





Tops: Shirts, blouses, t-shirts, sweaters.



Bottoms: Pants, skirts, shorts, jeans.



Outerwear: Jackets, coats, blazers, cardigans.



Shoes: Sneakers, boots, heels, loafers.



Accessories: Hats, scarves, belts, jewelry.



Store sorted items in a structured database (e.g., JSON or relational DB) with category metadata for efficient retrieval.



Display items in the UI grouped by category (e.g., "Shoes" section shows all detected shoes).

Outfit Recommendation Engine





Input Parameters:





User profile: Gender, body shape, skin tone, hair color, preferred occasion.



Real-time context: Weather (via weather API), temperature, time of day, and item usage history.



Recommendation Rules:





Each outfit comprises at least 3 unique core items (e.g., top, bottom, optional outerwear).



Accessories (e.g., hats, scarves) are optional and included only if available in the wardrobe.



Limit each itemâ€™s usage to 3 times per session to ensure variety.



Ensure all outfits and photos are unique, avoiding repeated combinations.



Prioritize unused or less frequently used items, leveraging usage history to maximize wardrobe diversity.



Category-Based Logic:





Select items from different categories (e.g., one top, one bottom, one pair of shoes) to ensure balanced outfits.



For outerwear or accessories, include only if suitable for the occasion and weather (e.g., jacket for cold weather).
